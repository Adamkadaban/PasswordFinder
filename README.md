# PasswordFinder
Simple script to find google passwords


This was made to be run on a network of computers on a kali linux installation (or probably anything else)

# How to use
run the command "ls >> users" in the Users directory

set the string at the top to a common prefix for usernames on the system

Don't use this with any intention of harm (I definitely don't have any liability if you do). I only made this to test some stuff in python.
